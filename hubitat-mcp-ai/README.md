# Hubitat MCP AI

Home Assistant add-on providing a native Ollama Online function-calling bridge
to kingpanther13's Hubitat MCP Rule Server.

Current add-on version: **0.16.85**.

## Architecture

0.16.85 keeps the accepted performance retrieval architecture unchanged and consolidates the last presentation-integrity boundary. The broad performance path remains host-planned: a quiet case uses metrics, performance stats and one bounded recent-log read; a strong-outlier case may add at most one device-scoped and one app-scoped six-hour diagnostic log read. The normal path still uses zero exploratory agent model rounds and one final synthesis round.

The diagnostic validator now recognizes child fields by semantic role instead of exact model labels. `Finding`, `Confirmed Finding`, `Diagnostic Finding`, `Evidence`, `Diagnostic Evidence`, `Observed Evidence`, `Conclusion`, `Hypothesis`, `Diagnostic Hypothesis`, `Verification`, `Action` and `Next step` preserve the current diagnostic target unless another entity is explicitly named. This prevents a model wording variation from erasing a real scoped Nest/SenseCap investigation and then falsely claiming that no target-scoped evidence was read.

Host timing is now rendered atomically from one timing record. A source/signal name is never prefixed onto model-authored cadence numbers from another signal. If the answer discusses a host timing fact, the source, signal, timing kind, median/range and approximate cadence are rebuilt together from the same record. This specifically prevents a `CumulativeEnergyImported` label from inheriting `ActivePower` interval statistics.

The 0.16.85 validator also treats an existing scoped diagnostic read as authoritative. A `diagnostic_signal` receipt containing HTTP 408, connection timeout or similar failure evidence may support a calibrated failure/connectivity hypothesis while preserving the boundary that the exact implementation defect and contribution to longer-window busy percentages remain unproven. A repeated neutral activity receipt remains an observation rather than a causal mechanism, and sparse/no diagnostic evidence remains explicitly unresolved.

The older numbered-heading diagnostic rewrite is no longer chained after the format-independent validator. One consolidated guard now owns entity context, semantic child roles, timing/source integrity, same-second cluster boundaries, threshold-event wording and mechanism-specific action gating. This removes a second shape-dependent rewrite pass that could contradict an already-correct repair.

### Core design

- **Meaning-first control:** semantic plans describe user intent; the model never owns Hubitat device IDs, gateway payloads, or verification.
- **Host-owned grounding:** device identity, capabilities, live reads, writes, and post-write verification are deterministic and evidence-backed.
- **Current-turn evidence:** live/historical factual claims must come from this request's tool evidence, not prior assistant conclusions.
- **Fail-closed synthesis:** deterministic validators localize contradictions or unsupported causal/prescriptive claims without replacing supported analysis.
- **Bounded investigation:** history, logs, scheduler reads, and causal expansion use explicit limits and stronger evidence outranks broad fan-out.
- **Privacy-safe observability:** request metrics use a fixed vocabulary and do not expose prompts, credentials, session IDs, device names, or tool arguments as metric dimensions.

### Performance analysis contract

For broad Hubitat performance/optimisation requests, HomeBrain treats resource/performance statistics as measured findings and logs as observations.

A broad performance request that also asks for recommendations uses:

1. Host-planned `hub_get_metrics` for current hub resources and alerts.
2. Host-planned `hub_get_performance_stats` for measured app/device execution statistics.
3. One bounded recent `hub_get_logs` window (`30m`, maximum `100` rows).
4. If numeric performance rows cross internal retrieval-policy thresholds, at most one device-scoped and one app-scoped `hub_get_logs` read (`since=6h`, `limit=120`). These thresholds choose evidence; they are not health/severity classifications.
5. `hub_get_jobs` only when the user's objective explicitly asks about scheduler/job/polling cadence.
6. Zero exploratory pre-synthesis provider rounds for the normal broad performance+recommendation path.
7. One final performance provider synthesis pass; deterministic validators handle localized repairs without another cloud-model round.

The final answer must keep these distinctions explicit:

- High execution time, call volume, `pctTotal`, `pctBusy` and `stateSize` are measured values; they do not establish an implementation mechanism by themselves.
- Adaptive diagnostic evidence is classified before a mechanism conclusion is accepted. Explicit timeout/connectivity/failure evidence may support a calibrated hypothesis; repeated neutral activity does not prove causality; sparse/no observations remain unresolved.
- A successful target-scoped diagnostic read must never be described as "no target-scoped evidence" merely because the model changed label wording.
- Host-derived timing is authoritative. `regular_cadence`, `irregular_intervals` and `observed_gap` must remain distinct, and timing source/signal plus numeric interval values must come from the same host timing record.
- Exact event/update counts require an explicit tool/host count. A one-second cluster is not a recurring events-per-second rate and is not proof of literal simultaneity.
- Literal WARN/ERROR observations remain observations; they do not automatically explain longer-window performance totals.
- Configuration/implementation evidence is required before prescribing exact polling, reporting, retry, timeout, blocking-model or scheduler changes.
- A threshold label in an app name plus an `Event:` payload proves event processing/logging, not that the threshold condition evaluated true or an alert action fired.
- Empty/no-active health alerts support "no active alert", not categorical "very healthy" or "no optimisation needed" conclusions.

## Setup

1. Install and configure **MCP Rule Server** on Hubitat.
2. Copy its local MCP endpoint and token.
3. Create an API key in your ollama.com account.
4. Configure the add-on in Home Assistant.
5. Start the add-on and open its Home Assistant sidebar panel.

Typical configuration:

```yaml
hubitat_mcp_url: http://192.168.1.100/apps/api/123/mcp
hubitat_mcp_token: YOUR_HUBITAT_TOKEN
ollama_direct_cloud_enabled: true
ollama_direct_cloud_base_url: "https://ollama.com"
ollama_direct_cloud_api_key: YOUR_OLLAMA_API_KEY
ollama_direct_cloud_model: gemma4:31b-cloud
require_sensitive_confirmation: true
morning_health_check_enabled: true
morning_health_check_time: "07:00"
pushover_enabled: false
pushover_app_token: ""
pushover_user_key: ""
pushover_device: ""
ha_tts_enabled: true
ha_tts_notify_service: ""
ha_tts_media_stream: ""
```

The add-on uses authenticated Home Assistant ingress. The direct host-port mapping is disabled by default. Do not expose the direct port unless another authenticated access-control layer protects it.

## Optional local Ollama fallback

If you run `ollama serve` on a machine on your LAN, HomeBrain can try that model first and fall back to Ollama Online when it is unavailable:

```yaml
ollama_local_enabled: true
ollama_local_base_url: http://192.168.1.50:11434
ollama_local_model: gemma3:12b
ollama_local_connect_timeout_seconds: 3
ollama_local_timeout_seconds: 12
ollama_local_keep_alive_seconds: 120
```

## System Check and Pushover

`HealthAuditService` performs read-only Hub/MCP/device/battery/automation/log health checks and stores the latest snapshot under `/data`. The dashboard exposes the latest result, new/resolved findings, a manual **Run system check now** action, and **Send report to Pushover** when Pushover is configured.

## Home Assistant TTS

HomeBrain can use the Home Assistant mobile-app notify/TTS path when browser speech is unavailable. Leave `ha_tts_notify_service` empty when there is only one `notify.mobile_app_*` target; otherwise configure the desired service explicitly.

## Safety and evidence boundaries

Sensitive writes use the structured confirmation policy. Confirmed actions are revalidated before execution and mutation success is reported only from verified tool evidence.

For history and causal questions, HomeBrain separates observed state/event history, direct command or execution provenance, configuration/topology evidence, temporal correlation, hypotheses and unresolved gaps. Configuration alone does not prove a specific automation caused a transition. Temporal correlation alone does not prove who or what initiated an event.

Precise-location attributes are stripped from provider-bound tool results. Current-turn evidence is isolated per request and prior chat conclusions are not treated as live proof.

## API

These endpoints are intended to be reached through Home Assistant ingress:

- `GET /api/status` — MCP/Ollama/runtime readiness.
- `GET /api/dashboard` — cached live-state dashboard counts.
- `GET /api/health-audit` — latest stored System Check and schedule state.
- `POST /api/health-audit/run` — run the read-only System Check immediately.
- `POST /api/ask` — process a request through the unified MCP agent.
- `POST /api/chat` — compatibility alias for `/api/ask`.
- `POST /api/refresh` — refresh MCP tools and device manifest.
- `GET /health` — add-on health probe.

## Development and validation

The blocking test/release gates include Python compilation, architecture-module-map drift detection, the full pytest release gate, repository/version alignment, import analysis, release-assurance contracts, and a container smoke build.

Runtime modules under `hubitat-mcp-ai/rootfs/app/` must be documented in `docs/RUNTIME-MODULE-MAP.md`. Any runtime change requires a new add-on version and matching release notes.
